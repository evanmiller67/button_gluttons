- Will we be able to distributed swag when people get there?
- Can we hand out coupon codes instead of merchandise?
yeah, can def hand out sheaf and coupons. I'll show you how to make one-time-use coupons. shwag better tho. 

- What merchandise will we be able to put designs on? (We were thinking t-shirts, shot glasses, journals, buttons, water bottles, hats, messenger bags, patches, mugs, magnets, coasters, mouse pads, stickers, calendars) 
Maybe just a few things out of each category of merchandise to display what we are capable of printing on. 
	Merch-any. I wouldn't worry about showcasing, per se, but the more variety def more whimsy. just have to be overt about it being random and playful--I hate when people start coming up and asking for stuff. (happened at sxsw 2 yrs ago)


We just released photo-on-metal; any chance of something that we can hang up in the booth and bring back for the office?
	photo on metal sounds bad-ass. def, but do it soon, not sure what turn around time is.
